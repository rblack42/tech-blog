Introduction

.. wordcount::

This blog is a place where I can post technical writing on a variety of topics.
I am a researcher at heart, and I often find myself in the middle of exploring
some new technology. Since I am also a programmer, these studies often result in
the creation of new software, usually written in *Python*. The articles in this
blog are all written in *RestructuredText* and processed using *Python Sphinx*.

The entries found here are not ordered chronologically. Instead they will be
organized in topic area.

   This is a work in progress (continually!)
