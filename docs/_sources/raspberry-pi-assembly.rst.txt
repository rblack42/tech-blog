Raspberry Pi Assembly Language
##############################

Since I have retired, I have stopped using assembly language at any level. As
part of my work on parallel programming, I find myself engaged in building
several light-weight clusters to test high performance coding ideas.

I have found that a good way to figure out how things work in code ay the most
basic level on a machine is ot generate assembly language code while processing
a high ;evel program. Fortunately, many compilers make this a simple task. In
this note, we will create a simple **C** program, and then generate assembly
language using the *Gun* **C** compiler:

.. literalinclude::  ../code/hello.c
   :language: c
   :linenos:
