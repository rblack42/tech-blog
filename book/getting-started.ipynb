    "This guide assumes you have a computer you want to dedicate to development work, hopefully, one that is fairly new. That system needs to have sufficient space available for your development work. We will be using Python here, and several nice tools that let you document your work as you proceed. We will practice something called *Reproducible Research* in this project. That means other scientists (or developers) can read your notes and produce the same results as you! This is important since your results need to be verifiable if they are to be trusted by others!\n",

    "I taught Computer Science programming courses for many years. Loading (and unloading) student projects on my machine rendered it a mess after each term. To deal with this problem, I established a work pattern where I archived everything on the machine at the end of the term, then rebuilt it from scratch to support the next term. This is a fairly easy process on my Mac machines, much less easy on a Windows machine!"
